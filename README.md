The 'Open Oriented Objects' is a series of furniture pieces designed to be easily crafted, assembled, disassembled, recycled with reused materials.

The project is inspired by the 'open source' philosophy, where the source of the product is made publicly available. Additionally, the project aims to provide transparency by including information about the carbon footprint of the created objects. The overall goal of the project is to create functional furniture while minimizing waste and environmental impact.

Currently, the project contains two objects:
- OOO1: Coffee table
- OOO2: Sideboard
